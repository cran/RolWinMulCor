\title{Synthetic data set to test the functions of \emph{RolWinMulCor}
}
\description{
The data set \code{\link{syntDATA}} contains three columns, the first one is the time and the next three columns are sinusoidal time series that contains two periodical signals (at 11 and 21, with a phase of zero and amplitude of 1 --- please note that these quantities are dimensionless) contaminated by Gaussian noise (with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 0.25) for the intervals 1--100 (signal at 11) and 200--400 (signal at 21) and Gaussian noise (with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1) otherwise.
